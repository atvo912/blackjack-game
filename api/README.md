In order to run the API, run 'yarn prod' (runs 'yarn build' and 'yarn start') in order to compile TS to JS into the /api/dist/ directory and start server. 'yarn prod:forever' is also available to run the server using foreverjs.

This can be deployed on AWS EC2 with a remote connection to a deployed Mongo DBMS.
